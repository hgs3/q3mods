Quake 3 Arena mods I made back in college.

Head Hunter
===========

When a player dies, they drop a pokeball.  Pokeballs can be collected and cashed in for points.  The player who cashes in enough pokeballs wins.  Multiple pokeballs can be cashed in for double points.

Hot Potato
==========

One player randomly starts with the "hot potato" (the plasma gun), everyone else starts with non-damaging gauntlets.  The player with the hot potato will take damage until they pass the hot potato to another player (by hitting them with a plasma bolt).  The last player standing wins.

Zombies
=======

One player randomly starts as a zombie, everyone else is human.  Eaten human players become zombies.  The last human standing wins.
