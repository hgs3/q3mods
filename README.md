## Quake 3 Arena mods

Here is a collection of Quake 3 Arena multiplayer mods I have made.

### Head Hunter

When a player dies, they drop a pokeball.  Pokeballs can be collected and cashed in for points.  The player who cashes in enough pokeballs wins.  Multiple pokeballs can be cashed in for a point multiplier.

### Hot Potato

One player randomly starts with the "hot potato" (the plasma gun), everyone else starts with non-damaging gauntlets.  The player with the hot potato will take damage until they pass the hot potato to another player (by hitting them with a plasma bolt).  The last player standing wins.

### Zombies

One player randomly starts as a zombie, everyone else is human.  Eaten human players become zombies.  The last human standing wins.
